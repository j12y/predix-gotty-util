This is quick little demo / utility for setting up and running GoTTY in the
Predix Cloud with clients for PostgreSQL and Redis.

You can find out more about GoTTY here:
https://github.com/yudai/gotty

The binary-buildpack will run .profile.d/install.sh which downloads and makes
`gotty` executable.  It is a binary web server written in go that will emulate
a terminal.

# TODO

- [ ] pip -V
- [ ] aws cli
